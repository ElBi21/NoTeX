## Yeah sure, but what **_IS_** NoTeX to begin with?

In this repository I want to publish the template that I use for taking notes during university classes. I will update it from time to time. If you want to see my notes they'll eventually be uploaded in an (_maybe_) accesible cloud, since I'm not feeling like sharing them at the moment.

The template is under GPL license, and you are free to use my template. It's fine if you want to edit the template, based on your needs, but please don't edit a couple lines and then sell it as your own template.

## 1) Class structure & proposed project structure

How does the template work? There are two important files: the `notex.cls` class file and the `notexmacros.sty` package. An (unluckily not yet) overview of the contents of the files is available in the package documentation file, which is available in this repository's root.

This class can be used in any way you prefer. However, I personally suggest to use the following project structure:

```
├ 📁 assets
│ └ 📁 images
│   └ 📄 ...
│  
├ 📁 preamble
│ ├ 📄 chap1_lorem.tex
│ ├ 📄 chap2_ipsum.tex
│ └ 📄 ...
│
├ 📄 main.tex
├ 📄 notex.csl
└ 📄 notexmacros.sty
```

## 2) Special Thanks ❤️

I'd like to thank [SeniorMars](https://github.com/SeniorMars) for both his [repository](https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles) and his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtM1mrWjUo) over the way he takes notes with _LaTeX_, which inspired me to build my own template and taking notes with it. Oh btw, you should thank [Daniel Falbo](https://github.com/danielfalbo) too, since if he didn't ask me "_Hey, why don't you upload your notes on GitHub?_" then all this material won't be here.

If you want to contribute to the template, just feel free to do so!
