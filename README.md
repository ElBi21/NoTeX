# NoTeX

## Yeah sure, but what **IS** NoTeX?

In this repository I want to publish most of my university notes for subjects such as Calculus, Physics, Algorithms, and so on...

The repo will contain both my notes (under a CC 4.0 license) and my template, used to made them. The template is under GPL license (until I will find a CC 4.0 license file to replace the GPL one)
