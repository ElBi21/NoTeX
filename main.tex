\chapter{About these notes}
\label{chap:introduction}
\doclicenseThis
The decision of copyrighting this work was taken since these notes come from \textbf{university classes}, and to ask all the professors to actually agree on sharing these notes it's a kind of hassle. The notes are readable and can be shared, but \textbf{can't be modified}. If you find an error, then feel free to contact me via the socials listed in my \href{https://www.leonardobiason.com}{website}. If you want to share them, remember to \textbf{credit me} and remember to \textbf{not} obscure the \textbf{footer} of these notes. \\\\
\noindent Those notes were made during my first year of university at Sapienza. I came up with the idea of doing proper calculus notes because I understood how frustrating is to study calculus without the right support. These notes \textbf{do not} replace any professor, they can be an help though when having to remember some particular details. If you are considering of using \textit{only} these notes to study, then \textbf{don't do it}. Buy a book, borrow one from a library, whatever you prefer: these notes won't be enough. \\\\
\noindent The only suggestion I can give you is to do exercises: a \textbf{lot} of them. Only by practising you can truly learn math, so don't rely too much on the theory (unless you need to study it). \\\\
\noindent I hope that this introductory chapter was helpful. Please reach out to me if you ever feel like. You can find my contacts on my \href{https://www.leonardobiason.com}{website}. Good luck! \\\\
